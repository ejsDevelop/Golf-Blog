            <p>Last night Julie and I went to putt and chip at Forest Park G.C. This was the first time I have been able
                to do either b/c of my back for nearly a decade. This was Julie's first experience putting on a
                <strong>real </strong>green and first time chipping, ever</p>

            <p>Plan on watching some of the Memorial today. What a treat it is to listen to Jack (Nicklaus) for an
                extended period of time on the broadcast.</p>

            <p>Julie and I went to Forest Park G.C. tonight. We started off by putting. Without me mentioning it to
                Julie, she did her prayer routine to groove her putting stroke. After that, I helped her with her
                alignment, just by showing her where she was aimning. She immediatedly took to it. I wish I had her
                natural abilitly for alignment with her whole body. The improvement on her chipping was incredible! In
                total she has not hit a bucket yet and tonight she was doing well. I can't wait to go with her again.
                She is a fun, good and beaugtiful student!</p>

            <p>This is a shout out to all those wondering what I meant by praying and Julie with her putting routine.
                Get into your natural putting stance without a club, and letting your arms hang down, put them togehter
                like you are prayin and rock your shoulders back and forth. Feel like you have a triange and that you
                are rocking it with your shoulders.</p>
            <p>I am feeling a strong sense that I need to start this blog from the beginning with golf instruction for
                all of us to remember the basics.</p>

            <p>Julie and I went to Forest Park tonight to work on putting and chipping. She made quite a bit of
                improvement on both. I am super, uber, proud of her!.</p>

            <p>Hi everyone! Things are going good here in AZ. We are much more settled in now. I am trying to      decide if I want to get back into the golf industry or continue pursuing programming for a           career. Both are my biggest passion in life so I can't go wrong with either one really.</p>
